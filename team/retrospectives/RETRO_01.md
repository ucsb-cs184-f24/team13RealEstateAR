* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
    - We used the process of recording goal, change, and measurement.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
    - it went pretty well considering we had out retro meeting so late.
    -     We did see a few more markdown files with documentation
    -     We also saw saw much less unnesecary branches
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
    - I would advise the reto leader to avoid giving too much input in order to allow the team members to get their throughts down
