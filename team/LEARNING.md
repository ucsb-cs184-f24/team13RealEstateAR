Chris - I have no IOS development experience besides having recently read the documentation for SwiftUI. I have very little experience working
as a team in an environment like this, but I am comfortable with working as a team in general. My knowledge is mainly around AI, as that is
what I do research in. I also have no experience with augmented reality and will have to learn for this project. 

Animesh - I have little to no iOS development experience but I have started learning Swift and SwiftUI. I do have experience working with a team and the scrum methodology, as well as some experience in web-dev and using APIs. I also recently started with Machine Learning so I can also somewhat be useful in that field. Lastly although I haven't worked with AR technology yet, I do have experience working with VR in the Human-AI Integration Lab at UCSB.
