## Learning Goals
- Chris - I have no IOS development experience besides having recently read the documentation for SwiftUI. I have very little experience working as a team in an environment like this, but I am comfortable with working as a team in general. My knowledge is mainly around AI, as that is what I do research in. I also have no experience with augmented reality and will have to learn for this project. 

- Animesh - I have little to no iOS development experience but I have started learning Swift and SwiftUI. I do have experience working with a team and the scrum methodology, as well as some experience in web-dev and using APIs. I also recently started with Machine Learning so I can also somewhat be useful in that field. Lastly although I haven't worked with AR technology yet, I do have experience working with VR in the Human-AI Integration Lab at UCSB.

- Leo - I have some IOS development experience and some experience with ARkit. My interets are software engineering, AI, computer vision and HCI. I'm looking forward to work with team and build a userful mobile app project. Can't wait to combine AR with OpenAI api and create some cool features together.

- Angel - I have no prior IOS development experience but I have been looking into and learning Swift. I have some experience with scrum methodology and working with a team.

- Vedant - I have learned a little bit of Swift and iOS. I'm looking forward to improve my iOS and Swift skills this quarter. Also, I'm hoping to learn how to use and implement computer vision models.

- Zephyr - I love to learn more about Swift and AR mobile coding. Previously I had built Violett.com (feel free to play around with our user portal) for my company and mobile app version with Flutter with Bluetooth registration and tested on IOS. I also had experience in Android Java development. I've also interned at Appfolio(the property management company) building renter's insurance pages thus had a great interest in realstate.

## List of Impressions

 Benefit: 
 - We used python for backend so we can handle API calls more easily & have better integration with the vision model
 - Auth0.swift is secure and easy for user if we need passwordless access and Single sign on functionality
 - AWS cognito is easier for development and user info storage with AWS functionality enabled
 - ARKit will simlify a lot of the graphics that we will have to code, making it easier to for us to create the 3D objects without too much math

Challenge:
- Need to figure out how to make python scripts & models communicate with swift project
- Auth0.swift is less developer intuitive in terms of cloud storage development plus cost a lot
 - AWS cognito is less as specialized or flexible as Auth0 for advanced identity features (e.g., bot detection, breached password detection)
 - iOS is very restricitive, which might make it difficult to work with tools and models that aren't already integrated into the system
