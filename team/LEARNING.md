Chris - I have no IOS development experience besides having recently read the documentation for SwiftUI. I have very little experience working as a team in an environment like this, but I am comfortable with working as a team in general. My knowledge is mainly around AI, as that is what I do research in. I also have no experience with augmented reality and will have to learn for this project. 

Animesh - I have little to no iOS development experience but I have started learning Swift and SwiftUI. I do have experience working with a team and the scrum methodology, as well as some experience in web-dev and using APIs. I also recently started with Machine Learning so I can also somewhat be useful in that field. Lastly although I haven't worked with AR technology yet, I do have experience working with VR in the Human-AI Integration Lab at UCSB.

Leo - I have some IOS development experience and some experience with ARkit. My interets are software engineering, AI, computer vision and HCI. I'm looking forward to work with team and build a userful mobile app project. Can't wait to combine AR with OpenAI api and create some cool features together.

Angel - I have no prior IOS development experience but I have been looking into and learning Swift. I have some experience with scrum methodology and working with a team.

Vedant - I have learned a little bit of Swift and iOS. I'm looking forward to improve my iOS and Swift skills this quarter. Also, I'm hoping to learn how to use and implement computer vision models.
