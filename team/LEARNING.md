Chris - I have no IOS development experience besides having recently read the documentation for SwiftUI. I have very little experience working
as a team in an environment like this, but I am comfortable with working as a team in general. My knowledge is mainly around AI, as that is
what I do research in. I also have no experience with augmented reality and will have to learn for this project.
